# Binary Search Tree (BST)
This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and focuses on implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in JavaScript. A BST is a fundamental data structure used for efficiently organizing and managing data.

#Description
A Binary Search Tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node contains a value (key) and has at most two children: a left child and a right child. The tree is organized in such a way that:
  - All values in the left subtree are less than the node's value.
  - All values in the right subtree are greater than the node's value.
This ordering property allows for fast searching, insertion, and deletion of elements in the tree.

# Project Goals
-Implement a Binary Search Tree in JavaScript.
-Develop and test common BST operations like insertion, search, and deletion.
-Gain a better understanding of tree data structures.
