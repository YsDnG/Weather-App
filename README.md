# Weather-App
The Weather Application is a project developed as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It is designed to provide users with real-time weather information for their desired locations. In order to circumvent the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions typically encountered when making requests to external APIs, this version of the application utilizes a proxy called "Cors Anywhere."

The proxy, hosted at https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo, acts as an intermediary between the application and the weather data source, allowing the application to access the necessary data without CORS-related limitations.

By authorizing access to this proxy, users can seamlessly experience the Weather Application
